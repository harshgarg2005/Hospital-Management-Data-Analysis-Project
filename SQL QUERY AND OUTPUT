#What I am learned:-
# I worked with hospital billing data to find patients who paid more than the average for treatments from dermatology
# I first selected appointments linked to doctors in dermatology then totaled each patient's billing and compared
# it to the overall average to identify those who spent the most.

#Q.2 List all patients who have received more than >3 type of treatment?
#Ans:
SELECT
    DISTINCT p.first_name,
    p.last_name
FROM
    patient p
JOIN
    billing b ON p.patient_id = b.patient_id
WHERE
    b.amount > (SELECT AVG(amount) FROM billing)
ORDER BY
    p.first_name, p.last_name;

# What I am learned:-
# I worked with treatment records to find patients who had received more than three different types of treatments. 
# By joining the necessary tables and using GROUP BY with HAVING, I was able to count treatment types per patient. 
# This helped me better understand how to group and filter data in SQL.

#Q.3 What is the most common reason for a visit?
#Ans:
    SELECT
        reason_for_visit,
        COUNT(*) AS visit_count

        appointment
    GROUP BY
        reason_for_visit
    ORDER BY
        visit_count DESC
    LIMIT 1;

#OUTPUT:-
reason_for_visit	 |   visit_count
Checkup	           |   45

#What I am learned:-
# I used SQL to find the most common reason patients visited the hospital 
# By grouping appointment records by reason_for_visit and counting occurrences,
# I learned how to summarize and rank categorical data
# using GROUP BY COUNT() and LIMIT for quick insights in healthcare data.

# What i am learned
# how to use SQL JOINs across several tables doctors appointments and billing to determine the
# total amount of money made by each doctor.
# I gained knowledge about relational data aggregation by applying filtering with WHERE for "Paid" bills
# and analyzing revenue using GROUP BY and SUM().

#Q.7 Which doctor has the highest average billing amount per treatment?
#Ans:
SELECT
    d.first_name,  d.last_name,
    AVG(b.amount) AS average_billing_amount_per_treatment
FROM
    doctors d
JOIN
    appointment a ON d.doctor_id = a.doctor_id

Robert	           Davis	         3041.655322580646

# What i am learned
# I determined which physician charged the most on average for each treatment.
# I applied the AVG() function and linked the doctors, appointment, and billing tables using JOINS.
# Finding the best-performing physicians based on revenue efficiency was made easier 
# by sorting using ORDER BY and limiting the results.

#Q.8 For each month, what is the total number of appointments and total billing amount?
#Ans:
SELECT
    DATE_FORMAT(a.appointment_date, '%Y-%m') AS appointment_month,
    COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS total_appointments,
    SUM(b.amount) AS total_billing_amount
FROM
    appointment a
LEFT JOIN
    billing b ON a.patient_id = b.patient_id
GROUP BY
    appointment_month
ORDER BY

NULL                	     1002	                    2748290.1600000006

# What i am lerned
# I learned how to group data using DATE_FORMAT() on appointment dates in
# order to extract monthly trends from this analysis. 
# I used COUNT() and SUM() to determine the monthly total of appointments and billing 
# by joining the appointment and billing tables.
# My abilities in time-based data aggregation and reporting were enhanced.

#Q.9 List the patients who have appointments with 'Dr. David Taylor’?
#Ans:
SELECT
    DISTINCT p.first_name,
    p.last_name
FROM
    patient p

# What i am learned
# I worked on finding particular relationships in a healthcare database 
# by filtering and joining several tables.
# I strengthened query logic and data relationships by extracting patients connected to
# Dr. David Taylor by applying conditions on doctor names and utilizing joins between the
# patient, appointment, and doctors tables.

#Q.10 How many appointments are scheduled for each doctor?
#Ans:
SELECT
    d.first_name,
    d.last_name,
    COUNT(a.appointment_id) AS total_appointments
FROM
    doctors d
LEFT JOIN
    appointment a ON d.doctor_id = a.doctor_id
